# Connect 4 with Reinforcement Learning

This is a repository for training an AI agent to play Connect 4 using reinforcement learning. Currently, a Q-learning RL algorithm. This also supports 2 player mode.

## Dependencies

Pygame for python2.7

## Running the Program

Train a new agent manually

To initialize a new agent and begin a new game loop, simply run:

python2.7 connect4.py [iterations] 

(iterations is the number of iterations you want to train the computer which plays against itself) By default it is 20 if an argument is not provided

## Controls

Simply use left/right arrow keys to navigate across different columns of the board and press enter to drop a coin.
